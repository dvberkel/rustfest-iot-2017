# Raspberry Pi Setup

> This setup has already been done for you if you are attending the workshop. These steps are only necessary if you are replicating the setup at home.

The software on our Raspberry Pi is based on the `2017-09-07` version of the "Raspbian Stretch Lite" image, which can be [found here](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/).

Additionally, the following packages were installed via `apt-get`:

* `libssl-dev`
* `libdbus-1-dev`
