# IoT Workshop - Rustfest Zürich 2017

This workshop will be a hands-on training for developing bare-metal and embedded Linux systems using Rust. You will use Tock-OS to create a low power Bluetooth sensor node on a Hail development board, and build a Smart IoT Gateway using a Raspberry Pi 3. Training and hardware will be provided for developing Rust software on both Microcontroller and Embedded Linux based systems. Attendees will start with a working base example for both devices, and can build new functionality from there. Some experience with Rust and either (or both) Microcontroller or Linux systems is recommended.

## The Schedule

This workshop will be broken in to four major parts, each lasting about an hour with breaks:

1. Introduction and Background Information
2. Develop Microcontroller Software with TockOS
3. Develop Gateway Software on Embedded Linux
4. Additional Challenges and Free Work time

## The Hardware

Today, we will be working with two pieces of hardware:

> A [Raspberry Pi 3] board, acting as an IoT Smart Gateway
