# Cross Compilation

**TODO** - Some kind of intro about cross compiling

## Something Similar - ARM64
-----

### What Rust can do, and what it can't

- LLVM
- Toolchain dependencies

### Not every crate is pure, statically linked Rust!

- (C, ASM, DLLs)

### Using Cross to get a binary for your target

## Something Different - ARM Cortex-M
-----

### `std` vs `core`
### xargo - building `core` from scratch
### cross + xargo

- pain free embedded compilation
